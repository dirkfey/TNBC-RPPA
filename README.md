./rawdata/ contains the raw RPPA data  
./processeddata/ contains the processed data: mean aggregates over replicates, fold-changes, and infferred network changes  

load_RPPA_data: Load the RPPA data into matlab and pre-processes the data.  
analysis_\*.m: As indicated by their filename, the analysis_\*.m files are scripts performing the analysis tasks. The workflow is as follows:

The workflow is:  
load_RPPA_data  
analysis_sen_vs_res  
analysis_cluster_combined
